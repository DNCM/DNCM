<p class="normal">For 14 years Bob Rast and <span class="inlineCompanyName">RKR Composites</span> have been developing composite DN masts.<br />
The end result is their line of extremely durable, competitive DN racing masts available at affordable prices.<br />
All <span class="inlineCompanyName">RKR Composites</span> masts are custom built for the modern DN sail-cut
using aerospace epoxy and a mix of carbon-fiber, S-glass and E-glass. Blow-molding technology is used to assure the highest quality 
laminate.
