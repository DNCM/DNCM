About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blueprint placeholders is a collection of nearly 750 placeholder images,
optimized for the Blueprint CSS grid, useful for quickly prototyping designs.

This project arose out of a genuine need I had for placeholder images on a
Web project that I was working on at the University of St Andrews
(www.st-andrews.ac.uk).

I kept having to look-up the Blueprint grid.css or my own cheatsheet to work out
image dimensions and wished that I could have a set of ready-made images that
followed the Blueprint grid class names, to make them easy to use.

Having created the grid-based images down to 25 rows (450px) I created a bunch
of other, hopefully, useful images too.  I hope you find them as useful as I do.

Image dimensions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For full details about image dimensions please see the Blueprint placeholders
cheatsheets.


Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the images in this collection use the familiar Blueprint class names:
span-1 to span-24 (e.g. span-4.gif) and are overlaid with the images's
dimensions which makes them quick and easy to use. There are a number of
ready-made sets:

Grid
    Images to fit every combination of the grid down to 25 rows.

Ratio
    Images in both 4:3 (standard) and 16:9 (widescreen) ratios, spanning 1 to
    24 columns. All images are rounded up or down to the nearest pixel.

Ratio grid
    Images in both 4:3 (standard) and 16:9 (widescreen) ratios, optimized for
    the grid. All images are rounded up or down to the nearest line-height value
    to fit the grid.

Square
    If rectangles aren't your thing then how about squares? There are two sets:
    one fits the columns, the other fits the line-height (rows).

Extras
    As well as the basic images above you also get images for specific purposes:

    * Adverts
    * Amazon banners
    * Badges
    * Google maps
    * Icons
    * Vimeo videos
    * YouTube videos

All images were created using the excellent http://placehold.it/
by Brent and Russell.


Grid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The grid option enables you to use any combination of column (1-24) and
row (1-25) to keep your design true to the Blueprint grid. Rows are measured
by line-height (multiples of 18px). There are 600 images.

The format for grid-based images is simple:

    span-[number of columns]-rows-[number of rows].gif

e.g. images/grid/span-4-rows-5.gif (150 x 90)
     images/grid/span-5-rows-4.gif (190 x 72)


Ratio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ratio set gives you either 4:3 (standard ratio) or 16:9 (widescreen ratio)
images. These images are designed to perfectly fit the columns of the Blueprint
grid. You will notice that the images do not fit the rows of the grid.

The format for ratio-based images is simple:

    span-[number of columns].gif
        Standard (4:3) ratio image.

    span-[number of columns]-wide.gif
        Widescreen (16:9) ratio image.

e.g. images/ratio/span-12.gif      (470 x 352)
     images/ratio/span-12-wide.gif (470 x 264)


Ratio grid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ratiogrid set is exactly the same as the ratio set (offering either 4:3
(standard ratio) or 16:9 (widescreen ratio) images) except that these images are
now either rounded-up or rounded-down (± 10px) to the nearest line-height value
making them fit the grid exactly.

The format for ratio-based images is simple:

    span-[number of columns].gif
        Standard (4:3) ratio image.

    span-[number of columns]-wide.gif
        Widescreen (16:9) ratio image.

e.g. images/ratiogrid/span-12.gif      (470 x 342)
     images/ratiogrid/span-12-wide.gif (470 x 270)

Square
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two options for squares: you can fit them to the width of a column or
to the height of a line-height row (in multiples of 18px).

The format for square images is simple:

    span-[number of columns].gif
        Square determined by the width of the columns.

    rows-[number of rows].gif
        Square determined by the height of the rows.

e.g. images/square/span-12.gif (470 x 470)
     images/square/rows-12.gif (216 x 216)
